const warren_buffett = `Warren Buffett follows the Benjamin Graham school of value investing, which looks for securities whose prices are unjustifiably low based on their intrinsic worth. He has developed several core tenets to help him employ his investment philosophy to maximum effect. These tenets fall into four categories: business, management, financial measures, and value.

In terms of business tenets, Buffett restricts his investments to businesses he can easily analyze. In terms of management tenets, Buffett evaluates the track records of a company’s higher-ups to determine if they have historically reinvested profits back into the company or if they have redistributed funds to back shareholders in the form of dividends. In terms of financial measures, Buffett focuses on low-levered companies with high profit margins. Finally, in terms of value tenets, Buffett looks for companies with a special product and good profit margins.`;
